Hello! 
I'm Kassidy, I have spent the last year and a half at CrabNebula, honing my software development skills across the stack with Rust, TypeScript, and SolidJS. Previously, I began my software engineering journey at Ada Developers Academy, where I strengthened her knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and full-stack software engineering. After completing Ada's classroom portion, I interned at Indeed, gaining experience in API development. Prior to becoming a software engineer, I worked in healthcare for University of Washington Medical Center where I strengthened my interpersonal skills. I am strong communication skills and works well both independently and as a collaborative team player. I identify as a life long learner and love learning new technologies and am highly curious; I am not afraid to ask questions to ensure I have a solid understanding of any concept or idea.

Thank you for taking a look at my code sample and please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions for me.
